def loss_scoring(net, X, y=None, sample_weight=None):
    """Calculate score using the criterion of the net

    Use the exact same logic as during model training to calculate the score.

    This function can be used to implement the ``score`` method for a
    :class:`.NeuralNet` through sub-classing. This is useful, for example, when
    combining skorch models with sklearn objects that rely on the model's
    ``score`` method. For example:

    >>> class ScoredNet(skorch.NeuralNetClassifier):
    ...     def score(self, X, y=None):
    ...         return loss_scoring(self, X, y)

    Parameters
    ----------
    net : skorch.NeuralNet
        A fitted Skorch :class:`.NeuralNet` object.

    X : input data, compatible with skorch.dataset.Dataset
        By default, you should be able to pass:

          * numpy arrays
          * torch tensors
          * pandas DataFrame or Series
          * scipy sparse CSR matrices
          * a dictionary of the former three
          * a list/tuple of the former three
          * a Dataset

        If this doesn't work with your data, you have to pass a
        ``Dataset`` that can deal with the data.

    y : target data, compatible with skorch.dataset.Dataset
        The same data types as for ``X`` are supported. If your X is a Dataset
        that contains the target, ``y`` may be set to None.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    loss_value : float32 or np.ndarray
        Return type depends on ``net.criterion_.reduction``, and will be a float
        if reduction is ``'sum'`` or ``'mean'``. If reduction is ``'none'`` then
        this function returns a ``np.ndarray`` object.
