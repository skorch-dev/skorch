class SkorchDoctor:
    """SkorchDoctor helps you better understand and debug neural net training.

    By providing records activations, gradienst, and parameter updates, as well
    as useful plotting functions, this class can assist you in understanding
    your training process and how to improve it.

    This is heavily inspred by the tips from Andrej Karpathy on how to better
    understand the neural net and diagnose potential errors.

        - https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6sfmUTpUmc

    To use this class, initialize your skorch net and load your data as you
    would typically do when training a net. Then, initializea ``SkorchDoctor``
    instance by passing said net, and fit the doctor with a small amount of
    data. Finally, use the records or plotting functions to help you better
    understand the training process.

    What exactly you do with this information is up to you. Some examples that
    come to mind:

        - Use the ``plot_loss`` figure to see if your model is powerful enough
          to completely overfit a small sample. If not, consider increasing its
          capacity, e.g. by stacking more layers or using more units per layer.

        - Use the distribution of activations to see if some layers produce
          extreme values and may need a different non-linearity or some form of
          normalization, e.g. batch norm or layer norm. A different weight
          initialization scheme could also help.

        - Check the relative magnitude of the parameter updates to check if your
          learning rate is too low or too high. Maybe some layers should be
          frozen, or you might want to have different learning rates for
          different parameter groups, or an adaptive optimizer like Adam.

        - If gradients are too big, consider using gradient clipping. If the
          mangitude of gradients shifts over time, you might want to use a
          learning rate scheduler.

    At the end of the day, ``SkorchDoctor`` will not tell you what you need to
    do to improve the training process, but it will greatly facilitate to
    diagnose potential problems.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> net = NeuralNet(..., max_epochs=5)  # a couple of epochs are enough
    >>> from skorch.helper import SkorchDoctor
    >>> doctor = SkorchDoctor(net)
    >>> X_sample, y_sample = X[:100], y[:100]  # a few samples are enough
    >>> doctor.fit(X_sample, y_sample)
    >>> # now use the attributes and plotting functions to better
    >>> # understand the training process
    >>> doctor.activation_recs_  # the recorded activations
    >>> doctor.gradient_recs_  # the recorded gradients
    >>> doctor.param_update_recs_  # the recorded parameter updates
    >>> # the next steps require matplotlib to be installed
    >>> doctor.plot_loss()
    >>> doctor.plot_activations()
    >>> doctor.plot_gradients()
    >>> doctor.plot_param_updates()
    >>> doctor.plot_activations_over_time(<layer-name>)
    >>> doctor.plot_gradients_over_time(<param-name>)

    Notes
    -----
    Even if a train/valid split is used for the net, only training data is
    recorded.

    Since ``SkorchDoctor`` will record a lot of values, you should expect an
    increase in memory usage and training time. However, it's sufficient to
    train with a handful of samples and only a few epochs, which helps
    offsetting those disadvantages.

    After you finished the analysis, it is recommended to re-initialize the net
    or even better start a new process. This is because the net you passed is
    modified by adding hooks training it. Although there is a clean up step at
    the end, it's better to start fresh when starting the real model training.

    Parameters
    ----------
    net : skorch.NeuralNet
      The skorch net to be diagnosed.

    match_fn : callable or None (default=None)
      If ``match_fn=None``, all activations, gradients, and parameter updates
      are recorded.

      If not ``None``, this should be a callable/function that takes the name of
      a layer or parameter as input and returns a bool as output, where
      ``False`` indicates that this output should be excluded. As an example, if
      you have a module with a :class:`torch.nn.Linear` layer called ``"fc"``
      and you only want to keep records from that layer, and also not record any
      gradients on biases, the ``match_fn`` could be defined as:

      ``match_fn = lambda name: ("fc" in name) and ("bias" not in name)``

    Attributes
    ----------
    num_steps_ : int
      The total number of training steps. E.g. if trained for 10 epochs with 5
      batches each, that would be 50.

    module_names_ : list of str
      All modules used by the net, typically those are ``"module"`` and
      ``"criterion"``.

    activation_recs_: dict of list of dict of np.ndarray
      The activations of each layer for each module. The outer dict contains one
      entry for each top level module, e.g. ``module`` and ``criterion``. The
      values are lists, one entry for each training step. The entries of those
      lists are again dictionaries, with keys corresponding to the layer name
      and values to the activations of that layer, stored as a numpy array.

      This data structure seems to be a bit complicated at first but its use is
      quite straightforward. E.g. to get the activations of the layer called
      "dense0" of the "module" in epoch 0 and batch 0, use
      ``doctor.activation_recs_['module'][0]['dense0']``.

      If an activation is not a simple array, it is disambiguated. E.g. if it's a
      list, the name get a suffix of ``[i]`` where ``i`` designates the index in
      the list. Similary, when the output is a dict, a ``[key]`` suffix is
      added, where ``[key]`` is the key of the corresponding value in the
      dictionary.

    gradient_recs_: dict of list of dict of np.ndarray
      The gradients of each parameter for each module. The outer dict contains
      one entry for each top level module, e.g. ``module`` and ``criterion``.
      The values are lists, one entry for each training step. The entries of
      those lists are dictionaries, with keys corresponding to the parameter
      name and values to the gradients of that parameter, stored as a numpy
      array. Only learnable parameters are recorded.

      This data structure seems to be a bit complicated at first but its use is
      quite straightforward. E.g. to get the gradient of the parameter called
      "dense0.weight" of the "module" from training step 7, use
      ``doctor.gradient_recs_['module'][7]['dense0.weight]``.

    param_update_recs_: dict of list of dict of float
      The relative parameter update of each parameter for each module. The outer
      dict contains one entry for each top level module, e.g. ``module`` and
      ``criterion``. The values are lists, one entry for each training step. The
      entries of those lists are dictionaries, with keys corresponding to the
      parameter name and values to the standard deviation of the update of that
      parameter, relative to the standard deviation of that parameter itself,
      stored as a float. Only learnable parameters are recorded.

      This data structure seems to be a bit complicated at first but its use is
      quite straightforward. E.g. to get the update of the parameter called
      "dense0.weight" of the "module" in the last training step, use
      ``doctor.paramter_udpate_recs_['module'][-1]['dense0.weight]``.
